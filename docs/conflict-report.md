For this part, I pretended the feature branches were written by different teammates.



I opened Pull Requests for each feature branch and added review comments as if I were reviewing someone else’s code. Each PR has at least two review comments pointing out improvements, questions, or suggestions.



On one of the Pull Requests, I used “Request changes” instead of approving it right away. After that, I made fixes on the same feature branch, pushed the updated code, and then re-requested a review. Once the issues were addressed, I approved the Pull Request.



After all reviews were complete, I merged each Pull Request into main using Squash and merge to keep the commit history clean. No direct commits were made to main.



This simulates a real team workflow where code is reviewed, feedback is given, fixes are pushed, and only approved changes are merged.
